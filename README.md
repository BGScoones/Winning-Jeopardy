# Winning-Jeopardy

In this proeject, I analyze patterns in previous Jeopardy! questions to try and develop a study-strategy for the show.
Three possible patterns are considered that, if present, will inform a study-strategy.
The first analyzes whether previous questions tend to be repeated.
The second analyzes whether the question can be infered from the answer.
The third analyzes the most common categories of questions.

The third analysis yielded the most successful results, although question categories were sufficiently varied that no single subject focus would be beneficial.
